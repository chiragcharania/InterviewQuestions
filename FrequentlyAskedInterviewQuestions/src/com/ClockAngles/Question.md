Determine the angles between the hands of clock
Input: int h1, int h2
Output: double angle
Constraints: 0 <= h1 <= 12 

Example 1:
Input h1 = 3, h2 = 45
Output = 180.00

Example 2:
Input h1 = 4, h2 = 57
Output = 222.00

Example 3:
Input h1 = 12, h2 = 00 
Output = 00.00

Example 4:
Input h1 = 12, h2 = 00 
Output = 360.00

Example 5:
Input h1 = 12, h2 = 60 // this does not mean it is 1:00, it simply means one hand is on 12 and other determines 60 minutes
Output = 00.00
