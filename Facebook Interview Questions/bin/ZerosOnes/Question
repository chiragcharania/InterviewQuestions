Given a List of zeros and ones write a function to move all 0's to the start and 1's to the end

Example:

Input: 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1

Solution:

We create two nodes head_0 and head_1

when we find 0 we add a node with data 0 to head_0 and we add a node with data 1 to head_1
we then point the head_0 to head_1 and return head_0
