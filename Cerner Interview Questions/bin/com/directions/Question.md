Given the point with coordinates: P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2) coordinates, determine where does the point P2 lie in respect to point P1

Example 1:
Input:
P1(1,1)
P2(1,-9)

Output:
S

Explanation: Point P2 lies to the south of Point P1  

Example 2:
Input:
P1(2,7)
P2(3,-9)

Output:
SE

Explanation: Point P2 lies to the South East of Point P1

Example 3:
Input:
P1(4,-1)
P2(4,3)

Output:
N

Explanation: Point P2 lies to the North of Point P1
